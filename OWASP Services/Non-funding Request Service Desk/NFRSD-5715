Describe your project
DevSecOps Council's Best Practices elucidates the method by which a secure software development pipeline may be effectively implemented. It underscores the integration of best practices and the adoption of pertinent tools to fortify the development process. Additionally, the project endeavors to instill a "shift-left" security ethos within the software development lifecycle. This initiative extends its utility to organizations of all sizes, each possessing a developmental pipeline, synonymous with a DevOps pipeline.

Our primary objective is to conceptualize a secure DevOps pipeline framework, with the ultimate aim of optimizing it to accommodate our specific, tailored requirements. The overarching goal is to expedite the identification of security issues, be they rooted in design flaws or application vulnerabilities, with utmost celerity.

Project roadmap
